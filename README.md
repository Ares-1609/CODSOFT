This repository contains 3 projects made by me using python programming language, I also used Python Tkinter library to make interactive GUI-based applications

1) The first task was to make a simple calculator that takes 2 numbers and an arithmetic operator as input from a drop-down menu, it then calculates the outcome and displays it to the user. I used tkinter python module to make a GUI based python code.
